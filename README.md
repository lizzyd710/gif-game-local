# gif-game-local
Sort of like Cards Against Humanity, but with gifs. This is the local "pass and play" version which I already completed, but I am working on making this game for android devices and working over a server.
Although I did finish it, there may still be some bugs. Create an issue or let me know and I'll get to fixing it.
