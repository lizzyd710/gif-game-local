Reaction to seeing the person you hate.
You get caught for murder. What do you say when the cops ask why you did it?
You in math class.
Getting your grades back.
A RABID BEAVER ATTACKS YOU.
When someone is being stupid.
When you see your OTP.
You in social situations.
When someone tells you to shut up.
When you ask for food and someone gives you vegetables.
When the teacher is wrong and you're right.
When you get home from school.
When you realize you have a project due tomorrow.
Something you say to your friend.
When you see your NOTP.
When people block the hallways.
When you have to do physical activity.
When you type your password in and the website says it's wrong.
